# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Tkinter.

## Features
- Play the game with two players: Player X and Player O.
- Track the score of both players.
- The game ends when one player wins or when there's a draw.
- Reset the game board with a button to start a new game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included in standard Python distributions)

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
2. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Run the following command to start the game:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe.py
4. A window will pop up with the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Two players can take turns to click on the grid and place their marks (X or O).
5. The score will be updated after each round, and the game can be reset by clicking the "Reset Game" button.

## How the Game Works
- Players take turns clicking on the 3x3 grid. Player X starts first.
- The first player to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the board is full and no player has won, it will result in a draw.
- You can reset the game using the "Reset Game" button.

## Game Controls
- Click on any empty cell to place your mark (X or O).
- Click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.
